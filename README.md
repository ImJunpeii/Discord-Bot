# Omg it's a discord bot !
Yeah it's a discord bot. Nothing special. I create simple commands with it, and use it for fun. You can yeet the code to yourself if you want, I don't mind.

# Features

## ;Ping && /ping
A simple ping-pong command. You say ping, it'll reply back saying pong!

## ;Say (message) && /say (message)
It's a copycat, it'll copy whatever you say.

## ;pp [user]
Shows how long their pp is. Each equal signs represents an inch. The minimum and maximum are ( 0:12 ) in inches.
